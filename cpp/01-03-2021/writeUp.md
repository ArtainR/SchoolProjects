# Exercise 1
## Part A
Snippet: [snippet1A.cpp](https://www.github.com/ArtainR/SchoolProjects/blob/main/cpp/01-03-2021/snippet1A.cpp)

### Input
N/A

### Output
```
For pi:
Number a is equal: 3.14159
It's approximately 3
Rounding down it's 3
Rounding up it's 4
As an integer it's 3

For e:
Number a is equal: 2.71828
It's approximately 3
Rounding down it's 2
Rounding up it's 3
As an integer it's 2
```

## Part B
Snippet: [snippet1B.cpp](https://www.github.com/ArtainR/SchoolProjects/blob/main/cpp/01-03-2021/snippet1B.cpp)

### Input
N/A

### Output
```
For pi:
The area of a circle with radius 2: 12.5664
For 3.14:
The area of a circle with radius 2: 12.56
Therefore, the relative error is: 0.000506952%
```

# Exercise 2
Snippet: [snippet2.cpp](https://www.github.com/ArtainR/SchoolProjects/blob/main/cpp/01-03-2021/snippet2.cpp)

### Example Input
```
2
3
5
7
```

### Example Output
```
Please input where point A lies on the X axis:
2
Please input where point A lies on the Y axis:
3

Please input where point B lies on the X axis:
5
Please input where point B lies on the Y axis:
7


The distance between points A(2, 3) and B(5, 7) is equal too: 5
```

# Exercise 3
Snippet: [snippet3.cpp](https://www.github.com/ArtainR/SchoolProjects/blob/main/cpp/01-03-2021/snippet3.cpp)

### Example Input
```
30
0.115
60
```

### Expected Example Output
```
Please input the angle of the incline: 30
Please input the torque of the object: 0.115
Please input the mass of the object: 60
Acceleration a = 4 m/s^2
```

### Example Output
```
Please input the angle of the incline: 30
Please input the torque of the object: 0.115
Please input the mass of the object: 60
Acceleration a = -10.0577 m/s^2
